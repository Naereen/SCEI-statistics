#+TITLE: Project

* Assumptions
- Can I suppose the proportion of female is independent between 3/2 and 5/2?

* Gather the data
** TODO (list all the URLs)
My progress is summarized in the [[./data_gathering.org][data gathering]] file.

* Manually look at the data
- The html is poorly formatted and difficult to automatically parse.
- The formatting changes from year to year, so I'd better do it carefully and manually parse it year by year.

Take a look, and fix what is fixable.
Then from what is available, remove unusable entries?
Get the statistics of interest.
Then, using the statistics (variation of female percentage throughout the selection process) and ranking of schools / Ecoles, see how the variation of female percentage evolves.
From the top ones, see how it evolves. Same for the low tier schools. (it is an elimination process, so expect a opposite trend).
